        <p>Here are answers to the most common questions we receive about our glass studio, services, and policies.</p>
<h2 id="studio--services">Studio &amp; Services</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Do I need experience to visit the studio?</strong>
A: No experience is required for studio visits! We welcome everyone to come see our artisans at work and learn about the glass making process. However, if you want to rent the studio for your own projects, some basic glass working experience is required.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I watch the glass making process?</strong>
A: Absolutely! We encourage visitors to observe our artisans at work. You&rsquo;ll see the entire process from molten glass to finished pieces. We&rsquo;re happy to explain what&rsquo;s happening and answer any questions you might have.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do you offer glass making classes?</strong>
A: We don&rsquo;t currently offer regular classes, but we do provide consultation and guidance for experienced glass workers who rent our studio. We can also arrange private instruction for specific techniques.</p>
<h2 id="custom-orders">Custom Orders</h2>
<p><strong>Q: How long does a custom order take?</strong>
A: Custom orders typically take 2-4 weeks depending on complexity and our current workload. We&rsquo;ll provide a specific timeline when you place your order.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What types of custom pieces can you make?</strong>
A: We specialize in hand-blown glass pieces including vases, bowls, sculptures, and decorative items. We can work with you on color, size, shape, and design to create something unique for your space.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do you require a deposit for custom orders?</strong>
A: Yes, we require a 50% deposit to begin work on custom orders. The remaining balance is due upon completion and before shipping or pickup.</p>
<h2 id="studio-rental">Studio Rental</h2>
<p><strong>Q: What&rsquo;s included with studio rental?</strong>
A: Studio rental includes access to all furnaces, annealing ovens, work benches, basic tools, and safety equipment. We also provide storage space for your materials and works in progress.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I need my own insurance?</strong>
A: Yes, we require proof of liability insurance for studio rental. This protects both you and us in case of any accidents or damage.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I rent the studio for just a few hours?</strong>
A: Yes! We offer hourly rental starting at $50/hour with a 2-hour minimum. This is perfect for small projects or one-time use.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What are your studio hours?</strong>
A: Our studio is open Monday-Friday 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM and Saturday 10:00 AM - 4:00 PM. We&rsquo;re closed on Sundays.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do you ship finished pieces?</strong>
A: Yes, we can ship finished pieces anywhere in the continental US. Shipping costs are calculated based on size, weight, and destination. We use professional packing materials to ensure safe delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What if I&rsquo;m not satisfied with my custom piece?</strong>
A: We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase. If you&rsquo;re not happy with your custom piece, we&rsquo;ll work with you to make it right or provide a full refund.</p>

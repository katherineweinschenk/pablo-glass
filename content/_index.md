Welcome to Pablo Glass, a gallery, shop and glass studio located in West Hurley, New York. Our gallery features hand-blown glass pieces created by local artists, alongside paintings, textiles, and gifts.

Visit our gallery and shop Friday through Sunday (11 AM - 6 PM) or by appointment Monday through Thursday. When the studio doors are open, you can watch our artists at work creating beautiful glass pieces. We also offer studio rental for glassblowing and can connect you with our network of skilled glassblowers.

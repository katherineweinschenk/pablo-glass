Here are answers to the most common questions we receive about our gallery and glass studio.

## Gallery & Shop

**Q: What can I find at your shop?**

Many glass pieces in the shop were created by Pablo or other artists in the studio next door. We also display other art mediums like paintings and textiles from other local artists. Smaller gifts such as coasters and jewelry are available as well.

**Q: Can you ship pieces?**

A: Yes, we can ship pieces. However, there is always a risk that glass will become damaged in transit. Please take this into consideration when requesting a piece to be shipped.

## Glass Studio

**Q: Can I watch the glass making process?**

A: Absolutely! Come in --- we'll be happy to explain what's happening and answer any questions you might have.

**Q: Do you take custom orders?**

A: We do not typically take small-scale custom orders (one glass, one vase, etc.). Get in touch to discuss commission projects.

**Q: Do you repair glass?**

A: In most cases, we are not able to repair glass, especially if not created by one of our artists.

**Q: Do you offer glass making classes?**

A: We do not currently offer regular classes.

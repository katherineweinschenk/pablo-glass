Here are answers to the most common questions we receive about our glass studio and shop.

**Q: What can I find at your shop?** 

The majority of pieces in the shop were created by Pablo or other artists in the studio next door. In addition to glass, you can find additional works of art like paintings and textiles from other local artists. Smaller gifts such as coasters and jewelry are available as well.

**Q: Do you take custom orders?** 

We do take custom orders! In the past, we've done vase commissions for wedding flower arrangements, batch drinking glasses, multi-piece wall sculptures, and more. Call us or DM us on Instagram to inquire about custom orders and projects. We *do not* typically take small-scale custom orders (one glass, one vase, etc.). 


**Q: Can you ship pieces?** 

Yes, we can ship pieces. However, there is always a risk that glass will become damaged in transit. Please take this into consideration when requesting a piece to be shipped.

**Q: Can I watch the glass making process?** 

Absolutely! Come in --- we'll be happy to explain what's happening and answer any questions you might have.

**Q: Do you repair glass?** 

In most cases, we are not able to repair glass, especially if not created by one of our artists.

**Q: Do you offer glass making classes?** 

We do not currently offer regular classes. It's hard to find teachers — if you want to teach, reach out!

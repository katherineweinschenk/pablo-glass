## Shop Hours

- **Friday - Sunday**: 11:00 AM – 6:00 PM
- **Monday - Thursday**: By Appointment

## Studio Hours

We keep the studio open during the warmer months and close when it's too cold to work. We can always give you a tour of the studio during shop hours — if you're lucky, you'll see some glassblowing in action!

## Stay With Us
